     NAME                      USN
1.R.PRATIKSHA               1KS18CS076
2.SINDU.A.S                 1KS18CS096
3.VARIDHI MADHURANATH       1KS18CS111

2.CONTRIBUTION OF EACH TEAM MEMBER:
a)R.PRATIKSHA:
Tracing the logic.Finding an approach to use Karatsuba algo in integer multiplication.Helped in implementation of command line arguments in java.
b)SINDU.A.S:
Correction of errors looking through hardcoding of inputs.
c)VARIDHI MADHURANATH:
Implemented the source code.

3.INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN THE PROGRAM:
a)Create a file with two positive decimal numbers in a text editor.
b)Compile the progam as:
javac Asn02p06.java
Run the program as:
java Asn02p06 filename.txt

4.DETAILS ON EXAMPLE INVOCATION AND OUTPUT:
Example:
INPUT:
8 8
OUTPUT:
Result of multiplication=64

5.CHALLENGES FACED AND HOW DID YOU ADDRESS THESE:
a)The concept of Karatsuba algorithm was learnt and implementing it as a code was out of box.
b)Implementation of source code without usage power library funtion was not met.
c)To improve the efficiency of program and by reducing the time complexity.
d)Since the input is through command line argument which is a filename ,implementation of this was challenging.

6.WHAT DID YOU LEARN FROM THIS ASSIGNMENT:
a)Implementation of Karatsuba algorithm.
b)Using the naive approach this problem would be solved in O(n**2),but Karatsuba algo would solve this problem in a very less amount of time.
c)Implementation of command line arguments in Java was learnt.
d)Learnt fast multiplication.
